# Chapter 3 The Preprocessor

*preprocessing*:
1.  Header inclusion
2.  Macro expansion
3.  Conditional compilation

## The `#include` Directive

The C and C++ standards only require that the needed definitions replace the
include directive in the text of the program before translation. They could
reside in tables internal to the preprocessor. Implementations are not obliged
to supply header information in physical files, nor need they name files after
the include directive. How, for instance, can a compiler supply a file named
`stdio.h` on a platform whose file system doesn't allow periods in a file name?

Because standard header names are special preprocessing tokens and not strings,
any backslashes in a header name are not escape characters.

```C++
#include <sys\stat.h>                 /* \, not \\ */
#include "\project\include\mydefs.h"  /* ditto */
```

## Other Preprocessor Directives

| Directive   | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `#include`  | Includes text of header or source file. |
| `#define`   | Enters a symbol into the symbol table for the current
compilation unit, with an optional valuee. |
| `#undef`    | Removes a symbol from the symbol table. |
| `#if`       | Control flow |
| `#elif`     | Control flow |
| `#else`     | Control flow |
| `#endif`    | Control flow |
| `#ifdef`    | Symbol table query directives. |
| `#ifndef`   | Symbol table query directives. |
| `#error`    | Prints a message to `stderr` and aborts. |
| `#line`     | Renumbers the current source line. Utilities, such as code
generators, use this to synchronize generated lines with original source lines
in error message. |
| `#pragma`   | Compiler-dependent actions. |

All preprocessor directives begin with the `#` character, which must be the
first nonspace character on its source line.

The `#define` creates *macro* definitions. A macro is a name for a sequence of
zero or more preprocessing tokens. The preprocessor keeps a table of all
symbols created by `#define`, along with the corresponding replacement text.
Whenever it encounters a token outside of a comment or a quoted string, it
replaces it with the corresponding replacement text.

We should use `const` variable definitions instead of *object like* macros.
1.  The compiler knows the semantics of the object, you get stronger
compile-time type checking.
2.  You can inspect `const` objeccts with a symbolic debugger.
3.  Global `const` objects have internl linkage unless explicitly declared
extern, so they can safely replace *objecct-like* macros.

You can define *function-like* macros with zero or more parameters:

```C++
#define beep()   putc('\a',stderr)
#define abs(x)   ((x) >= 0 ? (x) : (-x))
#define max(x,y) (((x) > (y)) ? (x) : (y))
```

There must be no whitespace between the macro name and the first left
parenthesis.
1.  Macro parameters are parenthesized in the replacement text to
avoid precedence surprises with complex argument expressions.
2.  You should also parenthesize the entire replacement expressions as well
to avoid surprises with respect to the surrounding text.
3.  It is also dangerous to use expressions with side effects as macro
arguments.

You can replace most *function-like* macros with inline functions/templates.

## Predefined Macros

Any predefined macros that a compiler provides must begin with a leading
underscore, followed by either an uppercase letter or another underscore.

| Macro         | Value                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `__LINE__`    | The number of the current source line                   |
| `__FILE__`    | The name of the source file                             |
| `__DATE__`    | The date of translation in the form "MMM DD YYYY"       |
| `__TIME__`    | The time of translation in the form "hh:mm:ss"          |
| `__cplusplus` | A long containing the date of the official C++ standard |
| `__STDC__`    | nonzero when compiling in standard mode                 |

To see the values of these macros:
```C++
int main() {
    __STDC__;
    __cplusplus;
}
```

```shell
gcc -E predefined.macros.c
g++ -E -std=c++11 predefined.macros.cpp
g++ -E -std=c++14 predefined.macros.cpp
g++ -E -std=c++17 predefined.macros.cpp
```

`assert` is a *function-like* macro in header `<cassert>`.

A C compiler is allowed to provide macro versions for any functions in the
standard C library (e.g., `getc` and `putc` usually come as macros for
efficiency). Except for a handful of required function-like macros (viz.,
`assert`, `setjmp`, `va_arg`, `va_start`, and `va_end`), an implementation
must supply true function versions of all functions in the standard C library.
A macro version of a library function in effect hides its prototype from the
compiler, so its arguments are not type checked during translation. To force
the true function to be called, remove the macro definition with the `#undef`
directive, for example

```C
#undef getc
```

Alternatively, you can surround the function name in parentheses when you call
it:

```C
c = (getc)(stdin);
```

This cannot match the macro definition because a left parenthesis does not
immediately follow the functio name.

## Conditional Compilation

The target of an `#if` directive must evaluate into an integer constant, and
it obeys the usual C rule that nonzero means true, zero false. You cannot use
casts or the `sizeof` operator in such expressions.

You can link C++ code with C code. You need to tell the C++ translator, via the
`extern "C"` linkage specification, not to "mangle" the external names that
match those in the C modules; for example,

```C++
extern "C" void f(); // f() was compiled under C conventions
```

The C portion of the C++ library needs to know whether to mangle names or not:

```C++
#if defined(__cplusplus)
extern "C"
{
#endif

<C declarations go here>

#if defined(__cplusplus)
}
#endif
```

## Preprocessing Operators

| Operator  | Usage              |
|-----------|--------------------|
| `#`       | Stringizing        |
| `##`      | Token pasting      |
| `defined` | Symbol table query |

```C++
#if defined(__MSCVER)
<put Microsoft-specific statements here>
#elif defined(__BCPLUSPLUS__)
<put Borland-specific statements here>
#else
#error Compiler not supported.
#endif
```

The `defined` operator evaluates to one if its target is present in the symbol
table, which means that it was either the subject of a previous `#define`
directive or the compiler provided it as a built-in macro.

The `#error` directive prints its message to `stderr` and halts the translation
process.

It isn't necessary to assign a macro a value.

```C++
#if defined(X)    <==>     #ifdef X
#if !defined(X)   <==>     #ifndef X
```

The `defined` operator is more flexible than the equivalent directives on the
right because you can combine multiple tests as a single expression:

```C++
#if defiend(__cplusplus) && !defined(DEBUG)
```

The operator `#`, the *stringizing* operator, encloses a macro argument in
quotes. It will ignore the spaces between itself and the parameter. For
example, 

```C++
#define trace(x, format) \
    printf(     #      x " = %" format "\n", x)
```

The expression `trace(i, d);`  expands to:

```C++
printf( "i" " = %" "d" "\n", i);
```

After the compiler concatenates adjacent string literals, it sees this:

```C++
printf( "i = %d\n", i);
```

There is no way to build quoted strings like this without the stringizing
operator, because the preprocessor ignores macros inside quoted strings.

The *token-pasting* operator `##` concatenates two tokens together to form a
single token. Any spaces surrounding the operator is ignored.

## Implementing `assert`

In general, when a macro must make a choice, it is good practice to write it
as an expression and not as a statement.

## Macro Magic

```C++
#define str(s) #s
#define xstr(s) str(s)
#define VERSION 2
```

It might appear that `xsrt` is redundant, but there is an important difference
between it and `str`. The output of the statement `str(VERSION)` is `"VERSION"'
but `xstr(VERSION)` expands to `str(2)` then the statement is rescanned, giving
`"2"`. Because arguments not connected with a `#` or `##` are *fully expanded*
before they replace their respective parameters. So in effect, `xstr` is a
version of `str` that expands its argument before quoting it.

The `#` operator inserts escape characters before all embedded quotes and
backslashes.

```C++
#define str(s) #s

str(abc     
       "de\f")
```

expands to

```C++
"abc \"de\\f\""
```

```C++
#define str(s, t) #s     t

str(abc
       "de\f",
   "hahaha")
```

expands to

```C++
"abc \"de\\f\"" "hahaha"
```

Two limitations:
1. If at any time the preprocessor encounters the current macro in its own
replacement text, no matter how deeply nested in the process, it does not
expand it but leaves it as is (otherwise the process would never terminate!).
For example,

   ```C++
   #define F(f) f(args)
   #define args a,b
   
   F(g)
   F(f)
   ```

   expands to

   ```C++
   g(a,b)
   F(a,b)
   ```

2. If a fully expanded statement resembles a preprocessing directive (e.g.,
if after expansion the result is an `#include` directive), it is *not* invoked,
but left verbatim in the program text.

## Character Sets, Trigraphs, Digraphs

A C translator only understands English alphanumerics, the graphics characters
used for operators and punctuators (there are 29 of them), and a few control
characters (newline, horizontal tab, vertical tab, and form-feed). This is the
*basic source character set*. The *execution character set* is
implementation-defined, but must contain characters representing alert ('\a'),
backspace ('\b'), carriage return ('\r'), and newline ('\n').

A C++ translator must also accept *universal character names*, which appear in
source text as one of the following:

```C++
\uNNNN
\uNNNNNNNN
```

where the `N`s represent a hexadecimal digit. The first form corresponds to the
ISO 10646 encoding `0000NNNN` (i.e., Unicode with leading zeros), and the
second to `NNNNNNNN`.

Many non-U.S. keyyboards do not support some of the elements of the basic
source character set, making it difficult to write C programs. To overcome
this obstacle, standard C defined a number of *trigraphs*, which are triplets
of characters from the Invariant Code Set (ISO 646-1983) found in virtually
every environment in the western world. Each trigraph corresponds to a
character in the source character set which is not in ISO 646. For examples,
whenever the preprocessor encounters the token `??=` anywhere in your source
text (even in strings), it replaces it with the encoding for the `#` character.

```shell
gcc -trigraphs -E trigraphs_demo.c
```

In an efffort to enable more readable programs worldwide, C++ defines a set of
*digraphs* and new reserved words for non-ASCII developers. Note that
digraphs are not handled by preprocessing.

## Phases of Translation

1. Physical source characters are mapped into the source character set. This
includes trigraph replacement and things like mapping a carriage
return/linefeed to a single newline character in MSDOS environments. In C++
programs, any character not in the basic source character is replaced by its
universal character name.
2. All lines that end in a backslash are merged with their continuation line,
and the backslash is deleted.
3. The source is parsed into preprocessing tokens, and comments are replaced
with a single space character. The C++ digraphs are recognized as tokens.
4. Preprocessing directives are invoked and macros are expanded. Steps 1
through 4 are repeated for any included files recursively.
5. Source characters, escape sequences in character constants, and universal
character names are mapped to members of the execution characters set (e.g.,
'\a' would be converted to a byte value of 7 in an ASCII environment).
6. Adjacent string literals are concatenated.
7. Traditional compilation: lexical and semantic analysis, and translation to
assembly or machine code.
8. (C++ only) Any pending template instantiations are performed.
9. Linking: external references are resolved and a program image is made ready
for execution.

The preprocessor consists of Step 1 through 4.
