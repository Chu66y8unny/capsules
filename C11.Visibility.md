## Classic Namespaces

An identifier can play various roles in a program.
[`same_identifier_various_roles.c`][] illustrates that `pair` is both a
function name and a `struct` tag.

The compiler keeps lists of identifiers used in different roles, so there is
no danger of ambiguity. These lists are called namespaces. There are four
different kinds of namespaces in standard C:

1.  labels
2.  tags for structures, unions, and enumerations
3.  members of structures and unions
4.  ordinary identifiers (i.e., all others: data objects, functions,
    typedefs, and enumeration constants).

In C++ you can use structure tags (which are really class names) without
the `struct` keyword. [`use_struct.cpp`][] illustrates that we can say
`struct pair p = {1,2};` and also `pair p = {1,2}`. Likewise
`class pair p = {1,2}` and `pair p = {1,2}`.

In other words, all `struct` and `class` names act as type names, as if you
had also defined a `typedef` with the same name as the tag. This means that
you cannot use a name as both a structure tag and a `typedef` for a
different type in the same scope. C++ has merged that namespace 2 and
namespace 4 above. As a compatibility gesture, you are still allowed to
define variables, functions and other entities in namespace 4 above with
the same name.

[`same_name_function_tag.cpp`][] and [`same_name_variable_tag.cpp`][]
illustrate that you can define a `struct` and a function or variable with
the same name in the scope.

However by doing this you cannot use the `struct` name anymore unless the
`struct` or `class` keyword is used explicitly. This is illustrated by
[`pair.cpp`][].

In short when using the same name for entities from namespace 2 and
namespace 4 above in the same scope, the name in namespace 4 hides the one
in namespace 2 and in order to use the one in namespace 2 `struct` or
`class` keyword must be explicitly used.

## Namespace Scope

A C++ namespace is an optionally named declarative region, allowing you to
group declarations together.

To use names from a namespace, you have three options:
1.  Use a fully qualified name
2.  *using declaration*
3.  *using directive*

A using declaration imports all overloads of a name.

A using declaration *is* a declaration and adds declarations to a
declarative region. The usual rules for declarations apply. Unless the
declarations in the same scope with the same name declare the same thing,
or the program is ill-formed. While a using directive is not a declaration, 
it only makes certain names usable in a declarative region.

Making a name usable in a certain scope, as opposed to declaring it, is
intended to be a much weaker thing. The name made usable by using directive
is not considered during qualified lookup, if there's another declaration
with the same name.

A name prefixed by the unary scope operator `::` is looked up in global
scope, in the translation unit where it is used. The name shall be declared
in global namespace scope or shall be a name whose declaration is visible
in global scope because of a using directive. The use of `::` allows a
global name to be referred to even if its identifier has been hidden.

For unqualified lookup, the names nominated by a using directive are
treated as members of the enclosing namespace and can cause ambiguity.

[`myname.h`], [`myname.cpp`], [`use_myname.cpp`] illustrates a namespace
and the usage of names from it.

[`unary_scope.cpp`][] demonstrates the unary scope operator looks up in
global scope.

[`namespace_alias.cpp`][] demonstrates you can declare an *alias* for a
namespace.

The *global namespace* is the declarative region outside of any namespace
block. The *unnamed namespace* is unique to each translation unit.

## Lifetime


## Lifetime of Temporaries

Compilers sometimes generate temporary objects when evaluating expressions
at runtime. In order to conserve resources, it is important for the compiler
to destroy temporaries early, but not too early.

The rule is that temporaries remain until the end of the *full expression*
in which they appear. In most cases, this just means until the end of the
enclosing statement, so that temporaries do not persist from one statement
to the next. A full expression is one that is not part of another
expression, such as an initializer; the controlling expression of an `if`,
`while`, or `switch`; the expressions in a `for`; and an expression returned
from a function.

The only exception to this rule is for references bound to a temporary. The
temporary persists as long as the reference in scope.
