## Classic Namespaces

An identifier can play various roles in a program.

[`same_identifier_various_roles.c`][]
illustrates that `pair` is both a function name and a struct tag.

The compiler keeps lists of identifiers used in different roles, so there is
no danger of ambiguity. These lists are called namespaces. There are four
different kinds of namespaces in standard C:

1.  labels
2.  tags for structures, unions, and enumerations
3.  members of structures and unions
4.  ordinary identifiers (i.e., all others: data objects, functions,
    typedefs, and enumeration constants).

In C++ you can use structure tags (which are really class names) without
the `struct` keyword.

[`use_struct.cpp`](code/C11.Visibility/use_struct.cpp) illustrates that we
can say `struct pair p = {1,2};` and also `pair p = {1,2}`. Likewise
`class pair p = {1,2}` and `pair p = {1,2}`.

In other words, all `struct` and `class` names act as type names, as if you
had also defined a `typedef` with the same name as the tag. This means that
you cannot use a name as both a structure tag and a `typedef` for a
different type in the same scope. C++ has merged that 2 and 4 above. As a
compatibility gesture, you are still allowed to define functions with the
same name as a tag.

[`same_name_function_tag.cpp`](code/C11.Visibility/same_name_function_tag.cpp)
and
[`same_name_variable_tag.cpp`](code/C11.Visibility/same_name_variable_tag.cpp)
illustrate that you can define a `struct` and a function or variable with
the same name in the scope.

However by doing this you cannot use the `struct` name anymore unless the
`struct` or `class` keyword is used explicitly. This is illustrated by
[`pair.cpp`](code/C11.Visibility/pair.cpp).

In short when using the same name for 2 and 4 above in the same scope, 4
hides 2 and in order to use 2 `struct` or `class` keyword must be
explicitly used.
